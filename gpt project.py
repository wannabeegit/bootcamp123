# Step 1: Data Collection (You would need to replace this with your own data source)
import requests

url = "https://api-football-v1.p.rapidapi.com/v3/odds/mapping"

headers = {
	"X-RapidAPI-Key": "6de4adc716msh2ee7a36505fc016p1d1b34jsnc8783d6fb7fc",
	"X-RapidAPI-Host": "api-football-v1.p.rapidapi.com"
}

response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)

print(response.json())

# Step 2: Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
# You might need to handle missing values, convert data types, and normalize data here.

# Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
# You can create visualizations and summary statistics to understand your data better.

# Step 4: Feature Engineering (You can add more features here)

# Step 5: Model Selection
# In this simplified example, we use linear regression to predict outcomes based on pre-match odds.
X = df[['pre_match_odds']]  # Features
y = df['final_outcome']  # Target

# Step 6: Data Splitting
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Step 7: Model Training
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Step 8: Model Evaluation
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
print(f'Mean Squared Error: {mse}')

# Step 9: Interpret the Model
# Analyze coefficients to understand how pre-match odds impact the final outcome
coefficients = model.coef_
intercept = model.intercept_
print(f'Coefficient: {coefficients[0]}, Intercept: {intercept}')

# Step 10: Predictions and Analysis
# You can use the model to make predictions for future matches.

# Step 11: Conclusion and Reporting
# Summarize your findings and conclusions here.
